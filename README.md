## How To Run The Project in Your System
Before starting the website, you will need to obtain the TMDB Movies API key. Follow these steps to obtain them and add them to your .env file.

▶️ Get TMDB API Key
- Go to https://www.themoviedb.org/ and log in.
- Click on your user profile picture in the navigation bar, and select "Settings".
- In the settings, select "API" and generate an API key.

▶️ Run the Website
Open your code editor (such as VS Code) and navigate to the project directory. Then, open a terminal and run the following command:

npm run dev
This will start the application. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the website.

Note: Ensure that you have carefully added the TMDB API key to your .env file. If the .env file is not working, add all the API keys and configuration manually.
